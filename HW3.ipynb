        "For this week's project, we're looking into ways to model sequential data. The first examples we discussed were, of course, things like video and audio, which have a highly time-oriented structure and can be divided into slices quite easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text classification may not necessarily be something we think of as being inherently sequential. We could, for example, build some decent predictive models that just focus on texts as purely a bag of words, and try to extract meaningful sentiment information with those words as individual units. But words don't really happen in isolation, natural language occurs as a stream, meaning that we may be able to get better predictions by representing this language sequentially. Of course, it is also entirely possible that the sequence doesn't reveal much about the semantics; however, it's definitely worth trying, as there may be some multi-word patterns that are especially valuable for prediction.\n",

It's possible to do this already using reviewers' provided scores, but the inherent flaw in this system is that people usually provide their own rating arbitrarily. Sites like Letterboxd, for example, are saturated with reviews that are hyperbolic or intended to be comedic, with users attaching 1 or 2 stars based on the point they want to make. But sites like this could easily benefit from having an in-house model that can provide a \"true\" negative/positive rating based on a classification of the actual review, rather than just the number of stars a user enters. This could maybe help ward off issues like review bombing and trolling, and give site users a secondary rating that goes beyond the typical, skewed star-based ratings.\n",

One of the major challenges in the study of language is the difficulty in coding speech beyond just the words a subject uses. If you are trying to do research on how respondents' answers to questions vary based on a certain kind of priming, for example, the biggest hurdle isn't eliciting the response, but coding it. Models incorporating embeddings (like what we're doing here) could provide more operationalized and consistent classifications of a respondent's answers, and offload very tedious work that may otherwise be undermined by qualitative coding issues. \n",

        "After talking with my teammates, we all found a few things to be true across our projects. One, models using `Conv1D` layers appeared to be performing the best, followed closely behind by my `LSTM` model with Glove weights. Two, paying attention to callbacks is very important to maximize your model's performance. And lastly, `RMSprop` is deinifitely the way to go for an optimizer. \n",

        "Interestingly, we had mixed success using the pre-trained weights. One teammate found them to be very effective, another said they re-ran their Glove model a few times and never got great results, albeit with the same number of available weights. Something worth exploring here is whether fewer weights does serve to improve accuracy. We also generally weren't sure of whether the number of embedding outputs and LSTM/RNN units was something to increase or decrease, since we used the same values for the most part. We all agreed that adding more units would certainly help depth and immediate accuracy, but could just be opening up the opportunity for overfitting. \n",

        "All of us moved forward with the same few parameters in mind. For one, we were all going to keep adding `Dropout` layers or parameters, since they seemed to be key to achieving consistent generalizability. Additionally, concluding a `Conv1D`-based model with a `GlobalMaxPooling` layer performed very well. I also wanted to experiment with `EarlyStopping`, as this proved very effective for one teammate in making sure they didn't incur too much validation loss.\n",

        "\n",
        "First, although it's definitely a valuable approach worth exploring, the complexity of an `LSTM` will not necessarily be the best approach for all language problems. The sequential aspect of the text data may not have been that important for classifying the overall sentiment of each review/headline. Everyone on my team had fairly effective Conv1D models and did not find an LSTM structure that was able to improve on it, though maybe more time to exlore hyperparameters would have revealed something in the smaller details.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additonally, all of these models benefitted greatly from callbacks and the \"in-between\" layers/parameters. For example, adding `Dropoff` both in the `LSTM` and the `Conv1D` models were essential for good generalizing to the competition Test data. Similarly, structuring the `Conv1D` models around a `GlobalMaxPooling` instead of a `Flatten()` proved to bring out greater performance. Though this was a valuable lesson from the previous project as well, these test models really demonstrated how important it is to not just get caught up in feeding the depth of your model, but also *extending* this depth to be as flexible as possible. \n",
        "\n",
        "Generally, this task was far more demanding of a design that was well thought-through. Working with Dropoff, keeping sequences, and learning rate reducers didn't just automatically make the model better; in the case of learning rate, for example, it may have conflicted with the function of `EarlyStopping` and prevented that from being as useful as possible. EarlyStopping was also a valuable design lesson, as it required a bit of tweaking to reach the balance between overfit prevention and sacrificed training time. Given that there are differing approaches you could take with representing this data, being mindful of these kinds of trade-offs will help you construct a model architecture that isn't subtley working against itself. With my final model, for example, I actually re-ran it's initial training period a few times to see how different EarlyStopping timings affected its performance; I observed that there definitely was a distinct possibility that too early of a cutoff will prevent your model from learning everything it needs to know about your data. \n",
        "\n",
        "I have a background in linguistics, and spent a lot of time learning much more qualitative attempts at modeling language. Implementing these models was fascinating because it made me consider both how much information you could extract from words alone, but also what you're still losing by being constrained to them. I can definitely see the advantages of an `LSTM` when it comes to trying to capture consistent multi-word patterns in how we express appreciation or contempt. But I wonder if capturing these patterns may sometimes create noise, especially when you have fairly condensed text extracts like the ones we were training with. "
